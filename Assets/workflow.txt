CORE PHYSICS
 - throttle process
 - stability torque
 - control authority by velocity
 - G limiter yaw
 - G limiter roll
 - Trim assist

 Get fucking github to fucking work again for fuck's sake
 



  CAMERA
 - Dynamic follow
 - Free look
 - Look at target

CORE UI
 - speed indicator
 - altitude indicator
 - throttle indicator
 - velocity vector


 WHEELS LOL
  - lol it bouncey
  - when hit ground it go boing boing
  - Nosewheel steering
  - Braking
  - Wheel raise/lower


OBJECT ORIENTIZE GAME OBJECTS
  - Think of individual computer modules connected to each other

FUEL SYSTEM
  - Draw fuel based on throttle level
  - Fuel/thrust efficiency changes based on altitude
  - Mass changes as fuel level changes?

COMBAT FLOW
 - game object system -- recognize others in playing field
 - HUD squares around other planes
 - destruction modeling
 - cannon

MISSILES
 - Physics
 - Tracking (simple radar. Maintain lock until outside of detection cone)

BASIC PLACEHOLDER MISSILE TYPES

TARGET TRACKING -- assume all game units always visible
 - Target selection -- select closest to nose
 - Target lock -- if selected missile seeker can see target within cone
 - create boolean for visibility -- draw box, selectable, lockable only if visible

CLOSE RANGE VISUAL TALLY
 - game unit visible if within visual range
 - visual range changes depending on angle. (High in front, medium in up and sides, extremely low behind and below)

RADAR SYSTEM
 - Current scan zone (show as large solid square)
 - Gimbal limits (show as large dotted square)
 - scan zone moves to camera, within gimbal limits
 - scan zone size can change? higher detection threshold for larger scan zone? -- NOT SURE IF THIS IS REALISTIC. NEED TO RESEARCH
   >> NOT REALISTIC. NARROW SCAN ZONE ONLY AFFECTS FREQUENCY OF TARGET UPDATES. DETECTION THRESHOLD IS NOT CHANGED.
   >> possible benefit would be reduced 'time to acquire' when bandit enters scan field
 - Target detectability parameters result in radar signature value
   > radar signature value must be above detection threshold to be visible
   > time to acquire? to avoid player using small scan zone and spazzing around to find enemies?
   > Target detectability parameters:
     >> COLOR UNIQUENESS (is target closing/running)
	 >> DISTANCE UNIQUENESS (what is behind target)
	 >> RANGE (how far is target)

 RADAR WARNING RECEIVER
  - Shows info about incoming radar energy (bearing, strength, type)
