          CONTROLS
============================

-------- Camera Toggle Controls -----------

"O" to toggle mouse autopilot mode
"L" to toggle camera-leveling. (When deactivated, camera rolls with aircraft, instead of staying level to horizon)
"P" to toggle controller camera aim
  - when inactive, lower right will show text boxes for weapon names, instead of graphical images
  - mouse autopilot mode overrides this, because mouse moves camera anyways
  - active, right stick on controller will move camera. (mouse autopilot must be off)

-------- Mouse control -------

Flight:
 - Green diamond indicates desired autopilot direction
 - Move mouse to move green diamond, airplane will automatically roll, pitch, and yaw towards desired direction
 - You can manually adjust pitch, roll, and yaw by using W and S for pitch, D and A for roll, and Q and E for yaw. Once the axis key is released, the autopilot resumes control of that axis.
 - Scroll mousewheel to change throttle
 - Hold SHIFT for free look. Allows camera  movement without changing autopilot direction

Combat:
 - Left click to shoot machine guns
 - Right click to launch secondary weapon

Weapon Selection:
 - numbers 1-4 (NOT on numpad) to select weapon
 - Fwd/Back button on mouse to step to next or previous weapon
 - TAB key also steps to next weapon

Targeting Computer:
 - Click middle mouse button to select enemy target closest to center of screen. Selected target
  will have their icon blink.
 - Minimap will automatically scale to show target
 - To lock on, you must be using a weapon with appropriate radar, be within range, and have target within scan cone. Target icon will turn red, and you'll hear a continuous high pitch lock tone
   > Maverick: air-to-ground lock only. Cannot lock air targets
   > AMRAAM: air-to-air missile only. Cannot lock ground targets

Missile Evasion:
 - Press F to drop flares. For 1 second, this will make you invisible to any radar, be it SAM, aircraft, or weapon radar. While performing evasive maneuvers, pop these flares 1 second before missile strikes you.
   > these are a limited resource. you have 4 flare slots, each reload individually. Reload time is lengthy, so use the flares sparingly

Landing gear: 
 - press G to toggle landing gear
 - When landing gear is down, more drag is applied to aircraft. You can use this as an airbrake

Map:
 - Press M to step map scale in and out.
 - Range number shows the distance from top of map, to your location.

====================================
       Missile Flight Mechanics
====================================

Missiles use the same aerodynamics script that player does.

Missiles have limited onboard fuel.

So, the slower the missile goes, the less maneuverable it is.

To evade a missile, get the missile to slow down enough that you are more maneuverable than it.

Evasive maneuvers in any direction will make the missile perform course 
corrections, bleeding its speed.

When missile is a few seconds away, it's usually good to make sure you're turning in ANY other direction than directly towards, or directly away from the missile. Barrel-roll spiral maneuvers are pretty effective in these cases.

However, if you are too close to the missile at the time of launch, you simply will not have the time to evade enough to bleed the missile's speed enough. Only a well-timed flare will save you in this case. 

Respect the range of enemy missile launchers, and keep your distance until you have an opportunity to safely close
